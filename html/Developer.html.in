<h1><A name="developers">Developers' information regarding the $gBug processing system</a></h1>

<p>Initially, a $gBug report is submitted by a user as an ordinary mail
message to <code>submit\@$gEmailDomain</code>.  This will then be
given a number, acknowledged to the user, and forwarded to a mailing 
list (if configured).  If the submitter included a <code>Package</code>
line listing a package with a known maintainer the maintainer will get
a copy too.

<p>The <code>Subject</code> line will have
<code>$gBug#</code><var>nnn</var><code>:</code> added, and the
<code>Reply-To</code> will be set to include both the submitter of the
report and <var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code>.

<h2>Closing $gBug reports</h2>

<p>A developer who receives a $gBug from the tracking system, or sees it on
the mailing list, and takes responsibility for it should hit Reply in
their favourite mailreader,
and then edit the <code>To</code> field to say
<var>nnn</var><code>-done\@$gEmailDomain</code> instead of
<var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code>
(<var>nnn</var><code>-close</code> is provided as an alias for
<var>nnn</var><code>-done</code>).

<p>The address of the original submitter of the $gBug report will be
included in the default <code>To</code> field, because the $gBug system
included it in the <code>Reply-To</code>.

<p>Where applicable, please supply a <code>Version</code> line in the
<a href="Reporting.html#pseudoheader">pseudo-header</a> of your message when
closing a $gBug, so that the $gBug tracking system knows which releases of the
package contain the fix.</p>

<p>`Done' messages are automatically forwarded to the <code>$gDoneList</code>
mailing list, if the mailing list has been set up.

<p>The person closing the $gBug and the person who submitted it will each
get a notification about the change in status of the report.

<h2>Followup messages</h2>

<p>If a developer wishes to reply to a $gBug report they may simply reply
to the message (that will <b>not</b> mark the bug as done). Their reply will
(by default, if they respect the Reply-To: header) go to
<var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code>, and to the original submitter of
the $gBug report (note: this is two distinct addresses). The $gBug tracking
system will receive the message at <var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code>,
pass it on to the package maintainer, file the reply with the rest of the
logs for that bug report and forward it to a designated mailing list
(<code>$gSubmitList\@$gEmailDomain</code>).

<p>A developer may explicitly mail the bug's submitter with an email to
<var>nnn</var><code>-submitter\@$gEmailDomain</code>.

<p>If you wish to send a followup message which is not appropriate for
any mailing list you can do so by sending it to
<var>nnn</var><code>-quiet\@$gEmailDomain</code> or
<var>nnn</var><code>-maintonly\@$gEmailDomain</code>.
Mail to <var>nnn</var><code>-quiet\@$gEmailDomain</code> is filed in the
$gBug Tracking System but is not delivered to any individuals or mailing
lists. Mail to <var>nnn</var><code>-maintonly\@$gEmailDomain</code> is
filed in the $gBug Tracking System and is delivered only to the maintainer
of the package in question.

<p>Do <em>not</em> use the `reply to all recipients' or `followup'
feature of your mailer unless you intend to edit down the recipients
substantially.  In particular, see that you don't send followup messages
both to <var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code> and to
<code>submit\@$gEmailDomain</code>, because the $gBug system will then
get two copies of it and each one will be forwarded to the designated
mailing list separately.

<h2><A name="severities">Severity levels</a></h2>

<p>The $gBug system records a severity level with each $gBug report.  This
is set to <code>$gDefaultSeverity</code> by default, but can be overridden
either by supplying a <code>Severity</code> line in the pseudo-header when
the $gBug is submitted (see the
<a href="Reporting.html#pseudoheader">instructions for reporting $gBugs</a>),
or by using the <code>severity</code> command with the
<a href="#requestserv">control request server</a>.
Separate multiple tags with commas, spaces, or both.

<p>The severity levels are:

<dl>
$gHTMLSeverityDesc
</dl>

<H2><a name="tags">Tags for $gBug reports</a></H2>

<p>Each $gBug can have zero or more of a set of given tags. These tags are
displayed in the list of $gBugs when you look at a package's page, and when
you look at the full $gBug log.

<p>Tags can be set by supplying a <code>Tags</code> line in the
pseudo-header when the $gBug is submitted (see the
<a href="Reporting.html#pseudoheader">instructions for reporting $gBugs</a>),
or by using the <code>tags</code> command with the
<a href="#requestserv">control request server</a>.

<p>The current $gBug tags are:

<dl>
$gHTMLTagDesc
</dl>

<h2><A name="forward">Recording that you have passed on a $gBug report</a></h2>

<p>When a developer forwards a $gBug report to the developer of the
upstream source package from which the $gProject package is derived,
they should note this in the $gBug tracking system as follows:

<p>Make sure that the <code>To</code> field of your message to the author
has only the author(s) address(es) in it; put both the person who
reported the $gBug, 
<var>nnn</var><code>-forwarded\@$gEmailDomain</code> and
<var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code> in the
<code>CC</code> field.

<p>Ask the author to preserve the <code>CC</code> to
<var>nnn</var><code>-forwarded\@$gEmailDomain</code>
and <var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code> when they reply, so
that the $gBug tracking system will file their reply with the original
report. These messages are only filed and are not sent on; to send a
message as normal, send them
to <var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code> as well.</p>


<p>When the $gBug tracking system gets a message at
<var>nnn</var><code>-forwarded</code> it will mark the relevant $gBug as
having been forwarded to the address(es) in the <code>To</code> field
of the message it gets, if the $gBug is not already marked as forwarded.

<p>You can also manipulate the `forwarded to' information by sending
messages to <a href="server-control.html"><code>control\@$gEmailDomain</code></a>.

<h2><a name="owner">Changing $gBug ownership</a></h2>

<p>In cases where the person responsible for fixing a $gBug is not the
assigned maintainer for the associated package (for example, when the
package is maintained by a team), it may be useful to record this fact
in the $gBug tracking system. To help with this, each $gBug may
optionally have an owner.

<p>The owner can be set by supplying an <code>Owner</code> line in the
pseudo-header when the $gBug is submitted (see the
<a href="Reporting.html#pseudoheader">instructions for reporting
$gBugs</a>),
or by using the <code>owner</code> and <code>noowner</code> commands
with the <a href="#requestserv">control request server</a>.

<h2>Summary postings</h2>

<p>Every Friday, a list of outstanding $gBug reports is posted to a summary
mailing list (if set up), sorted by age of report. Every Tuesday, a list of
$gBug reports that have gone unanswered too long is posted, sorted by
package maintainer.

<h2><A name="requestserv">Reopening, reassigning and manipulating $gBugs</a></h2>

<p>It is possible to reassign $gBug reports to other packages, to reopen
erroneously-closed ones, to modify the information saying to where, if
anywhere, a $gBug report has been forwarded, to change the severities
and titles of reports, to set the ownership of $gBugs, to merge and unmerge
$gBug reports, and to record the versions of packages in which $gBugs were
found and in which they were fixed.  This is done by sending mail to
<code>control\@$gEmailDomain</code>.

<p>The <a href="server-control.html">format of these messages</a> is
described in another document available on the World Wide Web or in
the file <code>bug-maint-mailcontrol.txt</code>.  A plain text version
can also be obtained by mailing the word <code>help</code> to the
server at the address above.

<h2>More-or-less obsolete subject-scanning feature</h2>

<!-- (this is likely to be removed the next version?) -->

<p>Messages that arrive at <code>submit</code> or <code>$gBugs</code> whose
Subject starts <code>Bug#</code><var>nnn</var> will be treated as
having been sent to <var>nnn</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code>.  This is both
for backwards compatibility with mail forwarded from the old
addresses, and to catch followup mail sent to <code>submit</code> by
mistake (for example, by using reply to all recipients).

<p>A similar scheme operates for <code>maintonly</code>,
<code>done</code>, <code>quiet</code> and <code>forwarded</code>,
which treat mail arriving with a Subject tag as having been sent to
the corresponding <var>nnn-whatever</var><code>\@$gEmailDomain</code> address.

<p>Messages arriving at plain <code>forwarded</code> and
<code>done</code> - ie, with no $gBug report number in the address - and
without a $gBug number in the Subject will be filed under `junk' and
kept for a few weeks, but otherwise ignored.
