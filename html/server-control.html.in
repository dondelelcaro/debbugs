<h1>Introduction to the $gBug control and manipulation mailserver</h1>

<p>In addition to the mailserver on <code>request\@$gEmailDomain</code>
which allows the retrieval of $gBug data and documentation by email,
there is another server on <code>control\@$gEmailDomain</code> which
also allows $gBug reports to be manipulated in various ways.</p>

<p>The control server works just like the request server, except that it
has some additional commands; in fact, it's the same program.  The two
addresses are only separated to avoid users making mistakes and
causing problems while merely trying to request information.</p>

<p>Please see the
<a href="server-request.html#introduction">introduction to the request
server</a> available on the World Wide Web, in the file
<code>bug-log-mailserver.txt</code>, or by sending
<code>help</code> to either mailserver, for details of the basics of
operating the mailservers and the common commands available when
mailing either address.</p>

<p>The <a href="server-refcard.html">reference card</a> for the
mailservers is available via the WWW, in
<code>bug-mailserver-refcard.txt</code> or by email using the
<code>refcard</code> command.</p>

<h1>Commands available at the control mailserver</h1>

<dl>

<dt><code>reassign</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>package</var>
 [ <var>version</var> ]

  <dd>Records that $gBug #<var>${gBug}number</var> is a $gBug in <var>package</var>.
  This can be used to set the package if the user forgot the
  pseudo-header, or to change an earlier assignment.  No notifications
  are sent to anyone (other than the usual information in the processing
  transcript).

  <p>If you supply a <var>version</var>, the $gBug tracking system will note
  that the $gBug affects that version of the newly-assigned package.

<dt><code>reopen</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
 [ <var>originator-address</var> | <code>=</code> | <code>!</code> ]

  <dd>Reopens #<var>bugnumber</var> if it is closed.

  <p>By default, or if you specify <code>=</code>, the original submitter is
  still as the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack
  when it is closed again.

  <p>If you supply an <var>originator-address</var> the originator will be
  set to the address you supply.  If you wish to become the new
  originator of the reopened report you can use the <code>!</code>
  shorthand or specify your own email address.

  <p>It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
  recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so that
  they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it is closed
  again.

  <p>If the $gBug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
  change the originator.  To change the originator of an open $gBug report,
  use the <code>submitter</code> command; note that this will inform the
  original submitter of the change.

  <p>If the $gBug was recorded as being closed in a particular version of a
  package but recurred in a later version, it is better to use the
  <code>found</code> command instead.

<dt><code>found</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [ <var>version</var> ]

  <dd>Record that #<var>bugnumber</var> has been encountered in the given
  <var>version</var> of the package to which it is assigned.

  <p>The $gBug tracking system uses this information, in conjunction with
  fixed versions recorded when closing $gBugs, to display lists of $gBugs
  open in various versions of each package. It considers a $gBug to be open
  when it has no fixed version, or when it has been found more recently than
  it has been fixed.

  <p>If no <var>version</var> is given, then the list of fixed versions for
  the $gBug is cleared. This is identical to the behaviour of
  <code>reopen</code>.

  <p>This command will only cause a bug to be marked as not done if no
    version is specified, or if the <var>version</var> being marked found
    is equal to the <var>version</var> which was last marked fixed. (If
    you are certain that you want the bug marked as not done,
    use <code>reopen</code> in conjunction with <code>found</code>.</p>

  <p>This command was introduced in preference to <code>reopen</code>
  because it was difficult to add a <var>version</var> to that command's
  syntax without suffering ambiguity.

<dt><code>notfound</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>version</var>

  <dd>Remove the record that #<var>bugnumber</var> was encountered in the
  given <var>version</var> of the package to which it is assigned.

  <p>This differs from closing the $gBug at that version in that the $gBug
  is not listed as fixed in that version either; no information about that
  version will be known. It is intended for fixing mistakes in the record of
  when a $gBug was found.

<dt><code>submitter</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<var>originator-address</var> | <code>!</code>

  <dd>Changes the originator of #<var>bugnumber</var> to
  <var>originator-address</var>.

  <p>If you wish to become the new originator of the report you can use
  the <code>!</code> shorthand or specify your own email address.</p>

  <p>While the <code>reopen</code> command changes the originator of other
  bugs merged with the one being reopened, <code>submitter</code> does not
  affect merged bugs.</p>

<dt><code>forwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>address</var>

  <dd>Notes that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to the upstream
  maintainer at <var>address</var>.  This does not actually forward the
  report.  This can be used to change an existing incorrect forwarded-to
  address, or to record a new one for a $gBug that wasn't previously noted
  as having been forwarded.

<dt><code>notforwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var>

  <dd>Forgets any idea that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to any
  upstream maintainer.  If the $gBug was not recorded as having been
  forwarded then this will do nothing.

<dt><code>retitle</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>new-title</var>

  <dd>Changes the title of a $gBug report to that specified (the default is
  the <code>Subject</code> mail header from the original report).

  <p>Unlike most of the other $gBug-manipulation commands when used on one of
  a set of merged reports this will change the title of only the
  individual $gBug requested, and not all those with which it is merged.

<dt><code>severity</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>severity</var>

  <dd>Set the severity level for $gBug report #<var>bugnumber</var> to
  <var>severity</var>.  No notification is sent to the user who reported
  the $gBug.

  <p>For <a href="Developer.html#severities">their meanings</a> please
  consult the general developers' documentation for the $gBug system.

<dt><code>clone</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>NewID</var> [ <var>new IDs</var> ... ]

  <dd>The clone control command allows you to duplicate a $gBug report. It is
  useful in the case where a single report actually indicates that multiple
  distinct $gBugs have occurred. "<var>New IDs</var>" are negative numbers,
  separated by spaces, which may be used in subsequent control commands to
  refer to the newly duplicated $gBugs. A new report is generated for each
  new ID.

  <p>Example usage:</p>

  <pre>
        clone 12345 -1 -2
        reassign -1 foo
        retitle -1 foo: foo sucks
        reassign -2 bar
        retitle -2 bar: bar sucks when used with foo
        severity -2 wishlist
        clone 123456 -3
        reassign -3 foo
        retitle -3 foo: foo sucks
        merge -1 -3
  </pre>

<dt><code>merge</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>bugnumber</var> ...

  <dd>Merges two or more $gBug reports.  When reports are merged opening,
  closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any of the
  $gBugs to a new package will have an identical effect on all of the
  merged reports.

  <p>Before $gBugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same state:
  either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to upstream
  author address or all not marked as forwarded, all assigned to the
  same package or package(s) (an exact string comparison is done on the
  package to which the $gBug is assigned), and all of the same severity.
  If they don't start out in the same state you should use
  <code>reassign</code>, <code>reopen</code> and so forth to make sure
  that they are before using <code>merge</code>. Titles are not required
  to match, and will not be affected by the merge.

  <p>If any of the $gBugs listed in a <code>merge</code> command is already
  merged with another $gBug then all the reports merged with any of the
  ones listed will all be merged together.  Merger is like equality: it
  is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.

  <p>Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs; on the
  WWW pages this includes links to the other $gBugs.

  <p>Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all of
  the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

<dt><code>forcemerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>bugnumber</var> ...
  <dd>Forcibly merges two or more $gBug reports. The first bug is
  chosen as the master bug, and its seetings are assigned to the bugs
  listed next in the command. See the text above for a description of
  what merging means.

<dt><code>unmerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var>

  <dd>Disconnects a $gBug report from any other reports with which it may have
  been merged.  If the report listed is merged with several others then
  they are all left merged with each other; only their associations with
  the $gBug explicitly named are removed.

  <p>If many $gBug reports are merged and you wish to split them into two
  separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each report in one
  of the new groups separately and then merge them into the required new
  group.

  <p>You can only unmerge one report with each <code>unmerge</code>
  command; if you want to disconnect more than one $gBug simply include
  several <code>unmerge</code> commands in your message.

<dt><code>tags</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [ <code>+</code> | <code>-</code> | <code>=</code> ] <var>tag</var> [ <var>tag</var> ... ]

  <dd>Sets tags for the $gBug report #<var>bugnumber</var>. No notification
  is sent to the user who reported the $gBug. Setting the action to
  <code>+</code> means to add each given <var>tag</var>, <code>-</code>
  means to remove each given <var>tag</var>, and <code>=</code> means to
  ignore the current tags and set them afresh to the list provided. The
  default action is adding.

  <p>Example usage:</p>

  <pre>
        # same as 'tags 123456 + patch'
        tags 123456 patch

        # same as 'tags 123456 + help security'
        tags 123456 help security

        # add 'fixed' and 'pending' tags
        tags 123456 + fixed pending

        # remove 'unreproducible' tag
        tags 123456 - unreproducible

        # set tags to exactly 'moreinfo' and 'unreproducible'
        tags 123456 = moreinfo unreproducible
  </pre>

  <p>Available tags currently include <code>patch</code>, <code>wontfix</code>,
  <code>moreinfo</code>, <code>unreproducible</code>, <code>help</code>,
  <code>pending</code>, <code>fixed</code>, <code>security</code>,
  <code>upstream</code>, <code>potato</code>, <code>woody</code>,
  <code>sarge</code>,
  <code>sid</code> and <code>experimental</code>.

  <p>For <a href="Developer.html#tags">their meanings</a> please consult the
  general developers' documentation for the $gBug system.

<dt><code>block</code>|<code>unblock</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <code>by</code>|<code>with</code> <var>bug</var> [ <var>bug</var> ... ]

  <dd>Use to note that one bug blocks another bug from being fixed.
  The first listed bug is the one being blocked, and it is followed
  by the bug or bugs that are blocking it. Use <code>unblock</code>
  to unblock a bug.

  <p>Example usage:</p>

  <pre>
        # indicates that 7890 cannot be fixed until 123456 is fixed
        block 7890 by 123456
        # indicates that 7890 can be fixed before 123456 after all
        unblock 7890 by 123456
  </pre>

<dt><code>close</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [ <var>fixed-version</var> ]
 (deprecated)

  <dd>Close $gBug report #<var>bugnumber</var>.

  <p>A notification is sent to the user who reported the $gBug, but (in
  contrast to mailing <var>bugnumber</var><code>-done@$gEmailDomain</code>) the
  text of the mail which caused the $gBug to be closed is <strong>not</strong>
  included in that notification.  The maintainer who closes a report
  should ensure, probably by sending a separate message, that the user
  who reported the $gBug knows why it is being closed.
  The use of this command is therefore deprecated.

  <p>If you supply a <var>fixed-version</var>, the $gBug tracking system
  will note that the $gBug was fixed in that version of the package.

<dt><code>package</code> [ <var>packagename</var> ... ]

  <dd>Limits the following commands so that they will only apply to bugs
  filed against the listed packages. You can list one or more packages. If
  you don't list any packages, the following commands will apply to all
  bugs. You're encouraged to use this as a safety feature in case you
  accidentally use the wrong bug numbers.

  <p>Example usage:</p>

  <pre>
        package foo
        reassign 123456 bar 1.0-1

        package bar
        retitle 123456 bar: bar sucks
        severity 123456 normal

        package
        severity 234567 wishlist
  </pre>

<dt><code>owner</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>address</var> | <code>!</code>

  <dd>Sets <var>address</var> to be the "owner" of #<var>bugnumber</var>.
  The owner of a $gBug claims responsibility for fixing it.
  This is useful to share out work in cases where a
  package has a team of maintainers.

  <p>If you wish to become the owner of the $gBug yourself, you can use the
  <code>!</code> shorthand or specify your own email address.</p>

<dt><code>noowner</code> <var>bugnumber</var>

  <dd>Forgets any idea that the $gBug has an owner other than the usual
  maintainer.  If the $gBug had no owner recorded then this will do nothing.

<dt><code>archive</code> <var>bugnumber</var>

  <dd>Archives a $gBug that was previously archived if the $gBug
  fulfills the requirements for archival, ignoring time.

<dt><code>unarchive</code> <var>bugnumber</var>

  <dd>Unarchives a $gBug that was previously archived. Unarchival
  should generally be coupled with reopen and found/fixed as
  approprite. Bugs that have been unarchived can be archived using
  archive assuming the non-time based archival requirements are met.

<dt><code>#</code>...

  <dd>One-line comment. The <code>#</code> must be at the start of the line.
  The text of comments will be included in the acknowledgement sent to the
  sender and to affected maintainers, so you can use this to document the
  reasons for your commands.

<dt><code>quit</code>
<dt><code>stop</code>
<dt><code>thank</code>
<dt><code>thanks</code>
<dt><code>thankyou</code>
<dt><code>thank you</code>
<dt><code>--</code>
<!-- #366093, I blame you! -->
<!-- <dt><code>kthxbye</code> -->
<!-- See... I documented it! -->

  <dd>On a line by itself, in any case, possibly followed by
      whitespace, tells the control server to stop processing the
      message; the remainder of the message can include explanations,
      signatures or anything else, none of it will be detected by the
      control server.
