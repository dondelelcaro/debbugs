The <: $config.bug :> you submitted against package '<: $old_package :>' has no
known maintainer. This usually means that you either did not include a
Package: pseudoheader, or you filed a bug against a non-existant
package. Your bug report has been reassigned to package
'<: $new_package :>' which is the default package for this bug reporting
system.
