## Upgrading Schema ##

To make changes to the database schema:

1. Make whatever changes are appropriate to the SQL directly in the
   debbugs_schema.sql file, and make corresponding changes to the
   database (or dump the entire database and otherwise make the
   changes).
    + If you add non-unique indexes, you will need to add an sqlt_deploy_hook
      (or edit an exist one) to add the index
2. Run `./sql/dbicdump_command.sh` to update the DBIx::Class classes which are
   under Debbugs::DB if you made changes to the database directly
3. Increment the version of Debbugs::DB;

Steps 1 and 2 can alternatively be performed by changing the
DBIx::Class classes directly if that is desired.
