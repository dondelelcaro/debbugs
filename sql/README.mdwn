## Upgrading Schema ##

To make changes to the database schema:

1. Make whatever changes are appropriate to the SQL directly in the
   debbugs_schema.sql file, and make corresponding changes to the
   database (or dump the entire database and otherwise make the
   changes).
2. Run `./sql/dbicdump_command.sh` to update the DBIx::Class classes
   which are under Debbugs::DB
3. Increment the version of Debbugs::DB;
4. Run `./bin/debbugs-installsql --install --deployment-dir sql --developer-prepare`
   and `./bin/debbugs-installsql --upgrade --deployment-dir sql --developer-prepare`
   which will generate the files necessary to do upgrades in the field.


Steps 1 and 2 can alternatively be performed by changing the
DBIx::Class classes directly if that is desired.
