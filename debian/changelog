debbugs (2.4.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Anthony Towns:
    - Add "package" command to service (control@) to limit the bugs that
      the following commands apply to.

  * Colin Watson:
    - Add (slightly) fancy CGI decoding of message/* MIME types.
    - CGI scripts now support multiple maintainers for a single package.
    - Add support for an X-Debbugs-No-Ack: mail header to suppress
      acknowledgements.
    - Document how to deliver mail to debbugs via procmail and SpamAssassin.
    - Implement new .status format that's extensible and easier to read; it
      now lives in .summary rather than .status. Use debbugs-upgradestatus
      to convert existing bug databases.
    - Implement bug ownership, with new 'owner' and 'noowner' commands and
      Owner: pseudo-header (closes: #133453).
    - Install Debian configuration in the binary package's examples
      directory (closes: #222118).
    - New standalone SpamAssassin queue runner, spamscan.
    - Allow # prefix on bug numbers in 'merge' command.
    - Fix some ordering issues in old-style package pages and summaries.
    - Add X-$gProject-PR-Message: headers to all mails sent by service.
    - debbugsconfig creates required directories in $gSpoolDir
      (closes: #222077).
    - Decode RFC1522 mail headers for display in the web interface.
      bugreport.cgi and pkgreport.cgi now output UTF-8.
    - Properly support multiple submitter addresses on a single bug.
    - Add a number of extra htmlsanit() calls to prevent cross-site
      scripting attacks.

  * Adam Heath:
    - Rewrite filtering in cgi's common.pl, to make it completely generic.
      Filtering can now work against any field.
    - Rewrite grouping logic in cgi's common.pl, to make it completely
      generic.  There is now no longer 2 nested loops, to do the grouping.
      This makes adding new grouping levels simpler for the future.
    - Add in a Table of Contents to pkgreport.cgi.
    - Display how long until a resolved bug will be archived in
      pkgreport.cgi.
    - Add user-agent detection.  This currently doesn't change anything,
      however.
    - Add options show_list_(head|foot)er.

  * Don Armstrong:

    - Don't remove the maintainer address if the message was sent by the
      maintainer and we're submitting to maintonly (closes: #140061)
    - Use uri_escape to escape URI's before sending them back out so the
      name of the file doesn't munge the query string. [#301606 pt. 1]
    - call decode_rfc1522 on the filename returned so that encoded
      filenames get decoded to something "reasonable." (closes: #301606)
    - We now require URI::Escape
    - Added apache.conf to examples, which is a sample apache
      configuration file which implements the rewrite rules that are
      currently used on bugs.debian.org. (closes: #222264)
    - Change spamscan.in to work with SA 3.0; This is an incompatible
      change with SA 2.6, and as such, we now Suggests: spamassassin 
      (>=3.0) (closes: #290501)
    - Update MTA to exim4 (closes: #228597) and add instructions on using
      exim 4 (thanks to Marc Haber) (closes: #248335)
    - Added per bug subscription support to debbugs, which relies on an
      external MLM to actually deal with the requests; currently works with
      eoc and sends messages to bugnum\@$gListDomain. (closes: #34071)
    - Change bugreport.cgi to use Debbugs::Log and greately simplify the
      process of outputing the bug log.
    - All RFC1522 subject lines are decoded, both in the html information
      and the message headers. All messages are converted to UTF-8 whereever
      possible; all bugreport.cgi pages are now completely in UTF-8 to the
      degree possible using Encode.pm (closes: #46848,#238984)
    - Add a convert_to_utf8 function to Debbugs::Mime to make the above
      possible; abstracts functionality that was already present in the
      decode_rfc1522 fucntionality.
    - Individual messages can now be downloaded from each bug report
      (closes: #95373)
    - Uninteresting headers are now hidden by default, can be renabled
      with &trim=no (closes: #188561)
    - Fix postfix instructions in README.mail (thanks to Jeff Teunissen)
      (closes: #134166)
    - Display old severity when changing severity (closes: #196947)
    - All messages that originate from the BTS and either go to .log files
      or out to users are now properly RFC1522 encoded. (closes: #306068)
    - Add links to cloned bugs (closes: #217960) and forwarded records
      that look like urls in the html records output by bugreport.cgi.
    - Things that look like urls in message bodies are now linked
      (closes: #168962)
    - Add Debbugs::Mail module that has two important functions:
      send_mail_message and encode_headers. All mail handling in service.in
      and process.in now uses send_mail_message to send mail messages which
      tries as hard as possible to send a message; if it fails, only
      warnings are returned. This fixes bad addresses causing sendmail to
      exit and destroying the bug log. (closes: #191306)
    - Add rudimentary Test::More modules for testing Debbugs::Mime and
      Debbugs::Mail.
    - Allow X-debbugs-* to be set in pseudo headers. (closes: #179340)
    - Obey X-Debbugs-No-Ack in control@ messages. (closes: #201825)
    - Allow forwarded: and owner to be set at submit@ time.
      (closes:#128320)
    - Fix example rewrite rules to allow for #1234 and foo+bar@baz.com
      (closes: #321925)
    - Output proper charset for attachments (closes: #335813)
    - Use MIME encodings to attach messages in close and done.
      (closes: #136654)
    - Add a forcemerge command to service.in to allow forcibly merging
      bugs which are in the same package. (closes: #286792)
    - Make all packages lowercase to support packages with uppercase
      names, even though that's insane. (closes: #67067)
    - Change acknowledged to close (closes: #61341) and indicate who
      actually closed the bug (closes: #355968, #132274)
    - Fix the documentation of clone to indicate that you need at least
      one newID (closes: #276747)
    - Use create_mime_message to send all of the mails which may contain
      UTF8 material. (closes: #364026)
    - Add links to Closes: text for closed bugs. (closes: #320986)
    - Add X-$gProject-PR-Source: line (closes: #219230)
    - Use the %cats data structure properly in pkgreport.cgi
      (closes: #367514)

    - Split forwarded on commas for linking (closes: #367813)
    - Don't display duplicate bugs (closes: #348116)
    - Display links to archived bugs for all searches (closes: #53710)
    - Link to blocked bugs in the bugreport.cgi output (closes: #326077)
    - Don't ask for more bugs if there is no maintainer (closes: #355190)
    - Stop refering to developers on the index page (closes: #355786)
    - Change control@ stop regex and documentation to match eachother
      (closes: #366093)
    - Make it obvious when commands to control have failed
      (closes: #344184)
    - Fix javascript error in pkgreport.cgi (closes: #346043)

debbugs (2.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson:
    - Exit the CGI scripts straight away if the HTTP method is HEAD, to save
      pointless work.
    - Display pending+fixed bugs as "fixed in NMU", not "pending upload".
    - Add a man page for debbugsconfig.
    - Report original tags when changing them, closes: #170630.
    - Add missing <ul></ul> tags to db2html's output, closes: #50746.
    - Add a 'submitter' command to service, based on a patch by Matt Kraai.
    - Remove the final use of cgi-lib.pl, so it's gone. Remove copyright
      notices that were there due to using it.
    - Accept ';' as well as '&' as a CGI argument separator.
    - db2html now works with the new hashed database layout.
    - Disable the fixed severity in favour of the tag.
    - MIME-encoded messages to bugs are displayed in decoded form on the web
      interface (unless the "mime=no" parameter is used), closes: #136114.
    - Add facility to search by tag.
    - Fix rebuild script and add it to the example crontab, closes: #139696.

debbugs (2.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updating the package with what's in CVS, even though this might
    completely break things for people who've been using the previous also
    broken package. <shrug> :) Upped the minor version since the changes
    are noticeable, and uploaded to experimental, just in case.
  * Applied speedup patch, that uses references, instead of copies.
    Thanks to Thomas Smith. Closes: #87176. [Adam]
  * Reverted some parts of the speedup patch because it breaks the API.
    [Anthony]
  * Bugs that are tagged fixed are now listed in a separate section in the
    web pages. Patch from Colin Watson. Closes: #86922. [Adam]
  * Added support for an additional Maintainers.override file, which is read
    after the normal one. This allows the normal one to be externally
    updated, but still have local overrides. [Adam]
  * Put <title> and </title> on the same line as the title since some lame
    browsers don't seem to like it otherwise. [Josip]
  * Include a mailto: URI in the header for a bug report. [Adam]
  * Added support for filtering on subject with include=subj:foo (exact
    match, case sensitive). [Anthony]
  * Added a missing http://, thanks to Julian Gilbey. [Anthony]
  * Use by-*.idx indices to speed up pkgreport.cgi. [Anthony]
  * Support "maint=" in pkgreport to give packages without a maintainer.
    [Anthony]
  * Updated Postfix documentation. [Darren]
  * Use two variables in order to reduce the amount of path hard-coding.
  * Added support for storing the files in a hashed directory (db-h), with
    the same hash layout as archive/. [Adam]
  * Added support for tracing of bug state changes. This date is in
    $gSpoolDir/debbugs.trace. It is locked (as debbugs.trace.lock) while
    accessed, and appended to. Currently, nothing uses this trace file and
    it isn't even cleaned up, which can be easily fixed with a simple cron
    job. [Adam]
  * Tell sendmail to queue outgoing mail for later delivery, instead of
    immediate delivery. [Adam]
  * Added a keywords header to outgoing email responses. [Adam]
  * Use Resent-From: if From: doesn't exist. [Adam]
  * Added appropriate Reply-To: lines for the ACK messages that could use
    them. [Josip]
  * Add $gUnknownMaintainerEmail to the list of maintainers to mail in case
    an package with no maintainer is referenced. [Adam]
  * processall locks 'incoming-cleaner' before starting, so we don't have
    multiple copies of it running at the same time. [Adam]
  * Sort bugs tagged 'pending' as 'pending upload', between 'forwarded' and
    'fixed'. [Adam]
  * Add support for searching by source package.  pkgreport.cgi takes src=,
    and both pkgreport.cgi and bugreport.cgi have enhanced HTML headers now.
    [Adam]
  * Add support in the CGIs for:
    * 'raw' sorting. This does no grouping based on status or severity, and
      just lists bugs in number order.
    * reversing the order that bugs are displayed. This does not affect
      severity or status ordering.
    * inclusions/exclusions of status and severity. Also, support reverse
      sorting of the above.
  * Make it possible to ban people from control@bugs. [Anthony]
  * Don't lie about missing Subject:s being an RFC822 violation, because
    they aren't. [Anthony, Josip]
  * Added preliminary support for ###-request. [Adam]
  * Added preliminary fast indexing support. [Adam/Anthony (?)]
  * Added preliminary support for CC:ing <src>@packages.qa.debian.org.
    [Anthony]
  * Added preliminary cloning support. [Anthony]
  * Link to submitter's web page, patch from Matt Kraai. [Josip]
  * The autoconfig thing in the description is gone, closes: #124537.
  * Fix viewing archived bugs by source package, closes: #121082, #146484.
    [Colin]
  * Depends: libmailtools-perl rather than mailtools, closes: #113028.
  * Add MIME support to process and service, and depend on libmime-perl as a
    result, closes: #36813. [Colin]
  * Trim Bug#12345: from the Subject:, not "Bug#12345: [", closes: #78123.
    [Anthony]
  * Be more careful about loop detection, closes: #113514. [Adam, Colin]
  * Relax the syntax for 'tags' slightly, since people seem to use it that
    way accidentally a lot, closes: #96164. [Colin]
  * Give better feedback from pkgreport.cgi when querying a non-existent
    package name, closes: #93433. [Colin]
  * Remove support for -fixed address from receive, since nothing else
    supports it. [Colin]
  * Prevent people from reading the first line of arbitrary files through
    bugreport.cgi, thanks to Max <rusmir@tula.net>. [Colin]
  * Add working-for-me instructions for exim setup on non-dedicated sites,
    together with Chad Miller's suggestions, closes: #78688. [Colin]
  * Fix a few typos, closes: #146745, #152751.
  * Update the copyright file with the current list of maintainers and a
    pointer to ViewCVS.
  * Remove lynx-cfg, and use 'lynx -cfg=/dev/null' instead. [Colin]
  * Various other things, not worth mentioning here.

debbugs (2.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a check for unwanted characters in the part of request passed on
    to sendlynxdoc that gets passed to shell. [Josip]
  * Applied Rob Browning's patches to remove more Debian-only stuff,
    closes: #80077. [Josip]
  * Fixed the nextnumber misplacement (it should be in spool dir, not config
    dir), and added a note about running debbugsconfig after changes to
    config file, thanks to Rob for the hints. [Josip]
  * Changed Maintainer: to point to debian-debbugs. Added myself to
    Uploaders:. [Josip]
  * Fixed Lintian errors: file-in-etc-not-marked-as-conffile (except
    for lynx-cfg which is a gross hack anyway),
    virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends,
    debian-changelog-file-contains-user-emacs-settings.

debbugs (2.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed examples installation, debbugsconfig should actually work now,

  * Removed all traces of the package after purging, in postrm. [Josip]
  * Added pkgindex.cgi, package/maintainer/submitter indices. [Anthony]
  * Moved readparse to common.pl, since it's, well, common to all the cgi
    stuff. Other fixes in common.pl. [Anthony]
  * Moved some of the pkgreport.cgi logic from common.pl into pkgreport.cgi.
    [Anthony]
  * Random typo fixes in the CGIs. [Anthony]
  * Made the CGI scripts use the common.pl from their directory and not
    /usr/lib/debbugs nor ~ajt/newajbug. That stuff should actually _work_
    now, argh. [Josip]
  * Added bug subject and package name in closing messages. [Josip]
  * Fixed errorlib filename (removed the .in part), this stuff should
    actually _work_ now, argh. I shouldn't be repeating myself. [Josip]
  * Escape +'s in URLs, closes: #75220. [Anthony]
  * Skip checking for new installs or the config file, debbugsconfig needs
    to regenerate the HTML, and it will detect existing conffiles. [Josip]
